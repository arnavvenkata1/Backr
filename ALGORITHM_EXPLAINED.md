# 🧠 StartupSwipe AI Recommendation Algorithm

## YES, THE ALGORITHM IS WORKING IN REAL-TIME! 🚀

Every swipe you make actively changes what startups you'll see next. Here's how:

---

## 📊 How the Algorithm Works

### **1. Initial Sorting (Onboarding-Based)**

When you first start swiping, the algorithm uses your onboarding preferences to rank startups:

```swift
func calculateScore(for startup: Startup, preferences: UserPreferences) -> Int {
    var score = 0
    
    // 🎯 Sector Match (Highest Weight: +50 points)
    if preferences.selectedSectors.contains(startup.sector) {
        score += 50
    }
    
    // 💼 Funding Stage Match (+30 points)
    if preferences.investmentStage.contains(startup.fundingStage) {
        score += 30
    }
    
    // 📍 Location Preference (+20 points)
    for prefLocation in preferences.preferredLocations {
        if startup.location.contains(prefLocation) {
            score += 20
            break
        }
    }
    
    // 📈 Growth Rate based on Risk Tolerance (+20 points)
    switch preferences.riskTolerance {
    case .aggressive:
        if startup.growthRate > 300 { score += 20 }
    case .moderate:
        if startup.growthRate > 200 && startup.growthRate < 350 { score += 20 }
    case .conservative:
        if startup.growthRate < 250 { score += 20 }
    }
    
    return score
}
```

**Example:**
- You select "Web3" and "AI Voice" in onboarding → CryptoFlow and VoiceClone appear first
- You prefer Series A stage → Those startups get +30 points
- You're aggressive investor → High-growth (300%+) startups get priority

---

### **2. Real-Time Learning (Swipe-Based)**

As you swipe, the algorithm learns your **actual** preferences vs. what you said in onboarding:

```swift
switch decision {
case .saved:
    likedSectors[current.sector, default: 0] += 1  // ✅ +1 point to this sector
    
case .skipped:
    likedSectors[current.sector, default: 0] -= 1  // ❌ -1 point to this sector
}
```

**Real-Time Example:**

```
Onboarding: You said you like "FinTech"
Reality: You swipe right on 3 HealthTech startups, skip 2 FinTech ones

Algorithm learns:
- HealthTech: +3 points 🔥
- FinTech: -2 points 📉

Next batch of cards: MORE HealthTech, LESS FinTech!
```

---

### **3. Dynamic Replenishment (After Every 3 Swipes)**

When you've swiped through 3 cards, the algorithm automatically loads more startups **sorted by your learned preferences**:

```swift
func replenish() async {
    var newStartups = Startup.samples.shuffled()
    
    // Re-sort by CURRENT preferences (includes learned behavior)
    if let prefs = userPreferences {
        newStartups = sortByPreferences(newStartups, preferences: prefs)
        // This now includes your swipe history!
    }
    
    queue.append(contentsOf: newStartups)
}
```

**How learned preferences boost scores:**

```swift
// Add learned behavior to scoring
if let sectorScore = likedSectors[startup.sector] {
    score += sectorScore * 10  // Each like/dislike = 10 points!
}
```

## 🔍 How to SEE the Algorithm Working

### **Open Xcode Debug Console:**

1. Run your app in Xcode simulator
2. Open **Debug Area** (Cmd + Shift + Y)
3. Start swiping!

### **You'll See:**

```
✅ SAVED: MindfulAI (Mental Health)
📊 Sector Preferences: ["Mental Health": 1]

✅ SAVED: SleepTech (HealthTech)
📊 Sector Preferences: ["Mental Health": 1, "HealthTech": 1]

❌ SKIPPED: CryptoFlow (Web3)
📊 Sector Preferences: ["Mental Health": 1, "HealthTech": 1, "Web3": -1]

🔄 REPLENISHING: Sorted by preferences and learned behavior
📊 Current sector scores: ["Mental Health": 1, "HealthTech": 1, "Web3": -1]
```

**Translation:**
- You liked 2 health-related startups → Algorithm boosts health startups by +10-20 points
- You skipped Web3 → Algorithm reduces Web3 startups by -10 points
- Next replenishment → MORE health startups, FEWER Web3 startups

## 🎯 The Complete Scoring Formula

```
TOTAL SCORE = 
    Onboarding Sector Match (0 or 50)
  + Funding Stage Match (0 or 30)  
  + Location Match (0 or 20)
  + Risk Tolerance Match (0 or 20)
  + (Swipe History × 10)  ← THIS CHANGES IN REAL-TIME!
```

### **Example Calculation:**

**Startup:** NeuroLink (BioTech)
**Your Onboarding:** Selected BioTech, Series B, Boston, Aggressive
**Your Swipes:** Liked 2 BioTech startups, skipped 1

```
Score = 50 (sector match)
      + 30 (Series B match)
      + 20 (Boston match)
      + 20 (high growth = aggressive)
      + (2 × 10) (liked 2 BioTech before)
      = 140 points! 🔥
```

**Startup:** CryptoFlow (Web3)
**Your Swipes:** Skipped 3 Web3 startups

```
Score = 0 (no sector match)
      + 0 (no stage match)
      + 0 (no location match)
      + 0 (no risk match)
      + (-3 × 10) (skipped 3 Web3)
      = -30 points! 📉 (appears LAST)
```

## 🧪 Test It Yourself!

1. **Complete onboarding** → Select "HealthTech" and "Mental Health"
2. **First batch** → You'll see MindfulAI, SleepTech, ElderCare+ early
3. **Swipe RIGHT** on all health startups (3-4 times)
4. **Watch debug console** → See sector scores increase
5. **Keep swiping** → After 3 swipes, new cards load
6. **Notice** → MORE health startups appear!
7. **Now SKIP** some health startups → Algorithm adapts again!

## 🚀 When Backend AI is Added

Currently: Algorithm learns from swipes locally
Later: Backend OpenAI will:

1. **Generate embeddings** for each startup (1536-dimensional vector)
2. **Calculate similarity** between startups you liked
3. **Find similar startups** you haven't seen yet (cosine similarity)
4. **Adjust match scores** using GPT-4 analysis of your behavior
5. **Predict** what you'll like BEFORE you swipe

**Current algorithm is like:** Netflix recommendations based on genres
**Backend AI will be like:** Netflix recommendations based on "People who liked X also liked Y"

🟡 FinTech (unchanged)
🔴🔴 Web3 (lower score!)
```

## 🐛 Card Loading Issue

If some cards don't show sector/graph:

**Cause:** Random data generation happens on first access
**Fix:** Each card regenerates monthly data on load

**Why this happens:**
```swift
var monthlyGrowthData: [Double] {
    // This generates NEW random data each time it's accessed
    // This is intentional for now (makes each company unique)
}
```

**To verify it's not a bug:** 
- Scroll through saved startups
- Each should show full data
- If blank, it's a rendering issue (not algorithm)

**Potential fix:** Pre-generate growth data in `Startup.samples` instead of computed property

Would you like me to fix the card rendering to make it more stable?
